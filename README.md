###H3 Part 6
To run the code for Part 6, first cd into the Part6 directory. Next, upload and run the StandardFirmataPlus file on the Arduino that is located in this directory. Next, you need to download and install NodeJS if you do not already have it (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). All of the dependencies are included in this directory, so there is no need to run npm install. Instead, to start the program, just type "node app.js" in this directory when the Arduino is plugged in.
